In this project, I learned how to build a modern portfolio website for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It started with basic HTML and CSS syntax. Next, I learned how to build custom web pages with an image gallery and contact page. - Learning resource: https://teamtreehouse.com - How to Make a Website.
